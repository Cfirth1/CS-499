## Introduction

Hello, my name is Caeli Firth, and I started attending SNHU for Computer Science. This GitHub Pages account provides an electronic portfolio showcasing my CS-499 projects and enhancements as I complete my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

## Education Review
  Throughout my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at SNHU, I have gained comprehensive knowledge and practical experience across multiple domains of computing. My coursework has emphasized software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, databases, computational graphics, and security practices, providing me with a strong foundation to solve complex problems and create professional-quality software.
  Beyond individual courses, the program emphasized integration of skills through collaborative projects, code reviews, and iterative development. These experiences taught me to plan and implement modular and maintainable solutions while considering trade-offs, security, and performance. My education has not only equipped me with technical expertise but also strengthened my professional communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, all of which are reflected in the artifacts included in my ePortfolio.

## Artifacts

The artifacts presented in this portfolio include projects in:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases

Through the course, I have improved my artifacts Through the course, I have improved my artifacts by creating new classes for my objects, implementing a collision detection system, and developing a database for managing textures in my OpenGL 3D rendering scene. These enhancements allowed me to organize my project more efficiently, improve the interactivity of my scene, and manage graphical assets in a structured way. By integrating these improvements, I have strengthened both the functionality and maintainability of my 3D application.

## Enhancement One:

**Artifact:** 3D Study Space Model 

**Description:**  
This artifact is a 3D study space scene created using OpenGL. Originally, the project used a single, monolithic code structure to manage all objects. I enhanced it by creating separate classes for each object in the scene, such as notepad , mug , and lamp. This refactoring improved code organization, readability, and maintainability, making it easier to add or modify objects in the scene.

**Enhancements:**  
  -Refactored the original code to implement object-oriented classes for each model in the scene.

  -Encapsulated object properties and behaviors within their respective classes.

  -Improved modularity, allowing for easier expansion and maintenance of the 3D scene.
  
**Skills Demonstrated:**  
  -Object-oriented programming and software design principles.

  -Code organization and modularization for maintainable, scalable projects.

  -Application of OpenGL to manage multiple independent objects efficiently.

## Enhancement Two:

**Artifact:** 3D Study Space Model

**Description:**  
This artifact is a 3D study space scene created using OpenGL. Building on the previous enhancement of creating separate classes for each object, I implemented collision detection to allow objects in the scene to interact realistically. This enhancement added interactivity and realism to the scene, ensuring objects do not overlap or pass through one another during movement.

**Enhancements:**  
  -Implemented collision detection algorithms to identify and respond to interactions between objects in real time.

  -Added logic to prevent objects from intersecting or passing through each other, enhancing realism.

  -Integrated the collision detection system with the object-oriented class structure from Enhancement One, maintaining modular and maintainable code.
  
**Skills Demonstrated:**  
  -Algorithm design and implementation for real-time collision detection.

  -Object-oriented programming, applying collision logic to individual object classes.

  -Problem-solving and debugging, handling edge cases and performance considerations in real-time rendering.

  -Understanding of 3D spatial relationships in OpenGL environments.

## Enhancement Three:

**Artifact:** 3D Study Space Model

**Description:**  
This artifact is a 3D study space scene created using OpenGL. Building on the previous enhancements of object-oriented classes and collision detection, I integrated a database system to manage and dynamically load textures for the objects in the scene. This enhancement allows the program to efficiently retrieve and apply textures at runtime, improving scalability and maintainability of the 3D environment.

**Enhancements:**  
  -Developed a database system to store and organize texture assets.

  -Implemented dynamic texture loading, allowing objects to retrieve textures from the database during runtime.

  -Optimized asset management, improving efficiency and enabling easy updates or additions of new textures.

  -Integrated the database functionality seamlessly with the existing object classes and collision detection system.
  
**Skills Demonstrated:**  
  -Database design and integration, creating a structured approach to managing textures.

  -Software engineering, combining database functionality with object-oriented design and collision detection.

  -Resource management and optimization, ensuring efficient texture loading and rendering performance.

  -Problem-solving and system integration, linking multiple components of the 3D scene for a cohesive, maintainable project.
